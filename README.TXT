Notes

You need Unity 4.5.5 to run this program with the Oculus and the free version of Unity.
Delete the Oculus package and all references to it otherwise. (The Network Manager spawns a Oculus using player.)

The Leap Motion components of this project will not work o Macs. For this reason, I have included them in the .gitignore.
Feel free to delete the Leap Motion components on your own machine.
